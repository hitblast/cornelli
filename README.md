# 🔮 write to your future self! <3

cornelli is your small terminal app for the times when you really desire to give your future self pats for the work you do; or for expressing any thoughts to them.

```bash
$ cargo install nelli
```

Or, get the goodie from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hitblast/cornelli/releases).

## 🪄 Usage

Get started by putting your thoughts away for a certain duration:

```bash
# unlocks after 20 days, 1 hour, 2 minutes and 1 second
nelli keep "Miss the board games with friends?" -d 20d1h2m1s
```

As time goes, let this command surprise you once in a while if you feel like it:

```bash
nelli mailbox
```

Hopefully you'll enjoy what comes next! :3

## ☘️ Compiling

```bash
cargo build --release --locked
```

# 🪄 Why

This is a Christmas project - a friend and I decided to spin up a friendly hackathon for building a time capsule of memories. And besides, what better way to set the mood for this day than creating something fun with the tools you have?
