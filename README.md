# 🔮 write to your future self! <3

cornelli is your small terminal app for the times when you really desire to give your future self pats for the work you do; or for expressing any thoughts to them.

</div>

## Usage

Get started by putting your thoughts away for a certain duration:

```bash
# unlocks after 20 days, 1 hour, 2 minutes and 1 second
nelli keep "You are doing great, keep going..." -d 20d1h2m1s
```

As time goes, you'll eventually be able to check back using the following command:

```bash
nelli mailbox
```

Hopefully you'll enjoy what comes next! :3

## Compiling

cargo build --release --locked
```
